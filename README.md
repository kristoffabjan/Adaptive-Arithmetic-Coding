Implementation of adaptive arithmetic coding by adjusting the basic arithmetic coding algorithm from https://neptune.ai/blog/lossless-data-compression-using-arithmetic-encoding-in-python-and-its-applications-in-deep-learning . Conditional probabilities were computed using laplace formula. We used code from https://towardsdatascience.com/huffman-encoding-python-implementation-8448c3654328 to implement Huffman coding. We also compared the efficiency of both adaptive arithmetic coding and huffman coding on a random string of characters from alphabet.
